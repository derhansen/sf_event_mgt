FAQ
===

Why do you not include a nice CSS stylesheet?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because you normally customize templates/stylesheets to your needs. Therefore the
extension just comes with a rudementary CSS stylesheet available in
EXT:Resources/Public/Css/events_default.css which must be included manually like
shown below::

	page.includeCSS {
	        events = EXT:sf_event_mgt/Resources/Public/Css/events_default.css
	}

Is it possible to extend events/registrations with own fields?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have created a demo extension, which shows how to add new fields to the event and registration
domain model.

Demo Extension: https://github.com/derhansen/sf_event_mgt_extend_demo

The extension contains a short manual (README.md) how to add your own fields to existing domain models.

How do I export registered participants to a CSV file?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please use the CSV export action as described in :ref:`backend-module` section.

How do I create a custom e-mail notification?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A detailed description can be found in the :ref:`custom-notifications` section.

Can I add the HMAC or an appended HMAC of the registration UID to e-mails?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, you can use the following objects in you e-mail templates

* {hmac} = HMAC of uid
* {reghmac} = appended uid+HMAC

Is it possible to filter by categories in the listview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, filtering of events by a category is possible if you pass the category to the overwriteDemand setting of the listview.::

 <f:link.action action="list" controller="Event" arguments="{overwriteDemand:{category: category}}">{category.title}</f:link.action>

This only works, if you create links with f:link.action as shown above. If you want to display the
categories in a select-box, then I suggest you create a CSS only select box (e.g. UL menu)

When does {event.registrationPossible} return TRUE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each event, the attribute registrationPossible returns TRUE or FALSE, if registration for
the event is possible. TRUE is returned, when all conditions below are

* Registration option is activated for the event
* Max participants is not reached (if max. participants > 0) or max participants is not reached and waitlist is enabled
* Date set at registration deadline is not reached
* Startdate of event is not reached

Why does the extenion not support recurring events?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The user registration is one of the main features of the extension and it requires, that every event is unique in order
to save registrations for a particular event. This makes it impossible to only have one event record, that has multiple
recurrences.

Since there is no smart way to add recurring events to the extension without making it more complex and harder to
maintain, this feature will not make it into the extension.

How can I disable double opt in for event registration?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can enable autoConfirmation for new registrations as described in the :ref:`tsref` section.
With autoConfirmation enabled, new registrations will automatically be confirmed and the user
will not receive a confirmation e-mail.

How does the simultaneous registration process work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the field "Max. simultaneous registrations per user" is set to a value greater than 1 for the given
event, a user is able to create multiple registrations at once. If the user in the registration view
chooses to create more than one registration, there will be created the given amount of registrations
in the backend for the user. All fields (e.g. firstname, lastname, email) will contain the same values.

The first registration saved is the "main registration", and all other registrations saved later will
depend on the "main registration". All "dependent registrations" will automatically get the option
"No e-mail notifications" set to true, so custom notifications are only sent to the e-mail address
of the "main registration".

If automatic confirmation is turned off (default), the user has to confirm the registration by clicking
a link in the confirmation e-mail. When the user confirms the registration, all "dependent registrations"
of the "main registration will automatically also be confirmed.

How can I set a default currency?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set default values for many fields in TYPO3 by using TCAdefaults. To set a default value for the
currency field, add the following to the Page TSConfig, which sets € as the default currency for new records::

 TCAdefaults {
   tx_sfeventmgt_domain_model_event.currency = €
 }


How to make the field "Accept terms and conditions" mandatory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The field "Accept terms and conditions" is part of the registration domain model, but it is not required
during registration. To make the field required, add the field to the list of required field like shown below::

 plugin.tx_sfeventmgt {
   settings {
     registration {
       requiredFields = accepttc
     }
   }
 }

How do I add my own custom translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can override all language files with your own translations/labels. As an example, the following code
overrides/extends the ``locallang_db.xlf`` and the ``locallang.xlf``

Add this example code to a ``ext_localconf.php`` file (e.g. in a site package extension).::

 $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['locallangXMLOverride']['de']['EXT:sf_event_mgt/Resources/Private/Language/locallang_db.xlf'][] = 'EXT:your_ext/Resources/Private/Language/de.custom_locallang_db.xlf';
 $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['locallangXMLOverride']['de']['EXT:sf_event_mgt/Resources/Private/Language/locallang.xlf'][] = 'EXT:your_ext/Resources/Private/Language/de.custom_locallang.xlf';


How can I use the overwriteDemand feature for the search view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to use the overwriteDemand feature for the search view in order to limit the
events that the search result includes. If you for example wish to limit the search to a special
category, you must pass the category UID as shown below (teh value field contains the category UID).::

 <f:form.textfield name="overwriteDemand[category]" value="1"/>


How can I add pagination to the listview?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the Paginate ViewHelper that comes with TYPO3 Fluid. Below follows example code which
should be added to the List-Template.::

 <f:widget.paginate objects="{events}" as="paginatedEvents" configuration="{itemsPerPage: 5, insertAbove: 1, insertBelow: 1, maximumNumberOfLinks: 10, addQueryStringMethod: 'POST,GET'}">
     <f:for each="{paginatedEvents}" as="event">
         <f:render partial="Event/ListItem" arguments="{_all}"/>
     </f:for>
 </f:widget.paginate>


How does the payment process work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each event with registration enabled, you can also enable payment. If payment is enabled, you can output
available payment methods for the event in the registration form. When a user registers for an event, he
can select a payment method.

The extension comes with 2 default payment methods "debit" and "transfer". Both payment methods do not include
any further payment processing.

It is possible to extend the extension with own payment methods that include furter payment processing (e.g. by
an external payment provider).

For more information on how to add custom payment methods, see :ref:`developer_payment` section

The default payment methods are missing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the extension settings in the extension manager and press the "Save" button.

Configured price options do not show up in frontend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure that the date for the price option is valid also make sure, that you use ``{event.currentPrice}`` in your
Fluid template to output the current price.

How can I use the iCalDownload action in the Listview?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The switchableControllerAction for the ListView does not allow to call the iCalDownload action. With the following
Fluid snippet, you can also use the iCalDownload in the listview::

 <f:link.action action="icalDownload" arguments="{event : event}" pageUid="{settings.detailPid}"><f:translate key="event.icalDownload" /></f:link.action>

Note, that you have to set the pageUid to a page with the detail view plugin.

Why does the next/previous month links not work for the calendar view ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next/presious links use the ``overwriteDemand`` feature, which by default is disabled. Make sure you have
unchecked the **Disable overwrite demand** setting in the plugin.

How do I show the event title as page title on the detail page?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can either use a SEO extension (e.g. ext:cs_seo), which has a custom and configurable page title rendering
function or you can use the title-ViewHelper of this extension.

How do I set the indexed search title for an event?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the title-ViewHelper of this extension.
